# Data Structures with Grokking Algorithms

Welcome to the **Data Structures Repository**, a comprehensive study and practical implementation of data structures inspired by the book **"Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People"**. All implementations are done in the Go programming language.

## ðŸ“– About This Repository

This repository is currently **under construction** as I continue to study and learn. As I progress through the concepts and exercises in *Grokking Algorithms*, I will be updating this repository with new data structures, algorithms, and improvements.

This repository serves as a resource for those interested in learning and implementing data structures, using the concepts and exercises from *Grokking Algorithms* by Aditya Bhargava. The book provides an approachable and visually rich guide to essential algorithms, making it ideal for both beginners and experienced programmers.

## ðŸ“š Contents

This repository covers:

- **Arrays and Lists**: Understanding basic data storage.
- **Hash Tables**: Efficient data retrieval techniques.
- **Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees**: Tree-based structures and search optimizations.
- **Graphs**: Representing and traversing networks.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Optimizing solutions to complex problems.

Each section includes:

- Explanations of the data structure or algorithm.
- Code examples in Go.
- Exercises and solutions inspired by the book.
